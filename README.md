## Push Swap 🏄‍♀️
In this project you are challenge to implement a sorting algorithm that involves manipulating two stacks following a combination of operations: pushing, rotating, reverse rotating, and swapping elements.  
Only a limited set of operations are allowed.  
To do this project, I implemented the [Turk Algorithm](https://medium.com/@ayogun/push-swap-c1f5d2d41e97), created by Ali Yigit Ogun: a student from 42 Heilbronn School.  

## How to use:

1. Clone the repository:
```c
git clone https://github.com/aldferna/Push_Swap.git
```
2. Compile the project:
```c
make
```
3. Run the program with the following syntax:
```c
./push_swap num1 num2 num3 num4 num5
```

🗒 **Example**
```c
./push_swap 8 5 2 4 9 1 3
```

## Visualizer
If you want to better understand how the algorithm is working I recommend you this [visualizer](https://github.com/o-reo/push_swap_visualizer):
